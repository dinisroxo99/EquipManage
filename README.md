# EquipManage

## Challenge 
### Application in ASP.NET and Blazor (WASM) with Entity Framework for database connection that allows managing a list of equipment:

The user has to be able to define some data of the equipment (name, model, etc.) – so that you show the creation of HTTP API endpoints in ASP.NET

The user has to be able to add an image of the equipment – so that you show how to send and receive files to that API

The user has to be able to define an availability calendar of the equipment – here the idea is to see what you propose as visualization of this calendar (HTML, CSS)

The user has to be able to add, remove and edit the equipment (of course)
